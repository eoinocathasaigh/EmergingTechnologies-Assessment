# Emerging Technologies - Eoin Ocathasaigh
This repository contains the code and resources for the Emerging Technologies course project by Eoin Ocathasaigh. The project explores various cutting-edge technologies and their applications. Within you will find a Jupyter notebook which serves as the main platform for experimentation and demonstration of concepts covered in the module.

Much of the work I demonstrate will be based off my research and understanding of the IBM Quantum computing resources, which can be found [here](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/learning/en/courses/basics-of-quantum-information/single-systems/introduction).

## Repository Structure
- `problems.ipynb`: The main Jupyter notebook containing the problems and solutions related to emerging technologies.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the repository.
- `requirements.txt`: A list of prerequisites and dependencies needed to run the code in the Jupyter notebook and the project in general.

## Core Concepts
The project focuses on several core concepts in emerging technologies, particularly in the realm of quantum computing. As highlighted by the problem titles in the notebook, these include:
1. **Generating Random Boolean Functions**
2. **Classical Testing for Function Type**
3. **Quantum Oracles**
4. **Deutsch's Algorithm with Qiskit**
5. **Scaling to the Deutsch–Jozsa Algorithm**
